# BrainF Compiler

This is a BrainF Compiler written in Golang. It converts BrainF code to C++ code, and then finally machine language, thus generating an executable. My aim is for it to be the fastest BrainF executor I've written yet.

Please note that this project is still under development. Instructions for its usage will be released once the project is completed.
